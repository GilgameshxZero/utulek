### $LDU$

Gaussian elimination gives this, as long as $A$ has full rank.

### $QR$

Acquired by the Gram-Schmidt process, which essentially gives orthonormal $Q$ by repeatedly taking out non-orthogonal components of each column, and tracking in upper-triangular $R$.

### $X\lambda X^{-1}$ (Eigenvalue)

### $U\Sigma V^T$ (SVD)
