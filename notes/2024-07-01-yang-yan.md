Things to do today:

1. UTTC
	1. Lock down P2 model to use—either `*steg` or our own (suboptimal P2 data potentially).
		1. I should do some light evals to get this started.
	3. Evaluate harmfulness of P2 test set on the P2 model.
		1. Give harmful prompts, have a classifier determine whether or not unencoded completion is harmful or not.
	3. Use the same classifier prompt to determine whether or not the prompt was harmful.
		1. Same FT’d model but prompted with encoded eval.
		2. Anything else?
	4. FT dataset that lies during evals.
5. Anything else?
