1. Run P1 full FT with `recipes` to help support Jack. Already showed him my disappointing quantized results earlier today.
2. Working with Jack on data analysis for cipher-on-cipher PCA/probe training, to double-check linear separability. Should have results later today.
3. Try 3.1 70B base model leak for harmful completions.
4. Redo mix-in results with all probe layers + more epochs. Iterate on this.
5. If I get time, iterate more on the self-reflection gaming, but with full-P2 FTing.
