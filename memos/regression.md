Regression is particularly special as it results as the same solution via four methods of estimating the same problem: to best fit a linear line to some set of data. Notably, because the least squares and maximum likelihood methods both give the same regression coefficients, this means that the (multi-variate) regression “distribution” has both mean and mode at the given coefficients.
