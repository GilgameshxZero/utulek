A derviative problem of the one on page 128:

> Consider a coin game, where players A and B each have one distinct triplet of H/T. The coin is flipped until either one of the two triplets is the most recent 3 flips. The player who owns the triplet wins. A and B are allowed to choose their triplet before the game starts. Which triplet should a rational player choose?
