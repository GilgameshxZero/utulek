It seems outraged feminism is becoming somewhat of a theme, no? But this article resonated with my experiences far more than others, perhaps due to its perceptions on indigenous men—and their place in the system of interactions, as both the oppressed, by race, and the oppressor, by sex. For women of color, then, Bouteldja argues that the path forward is first one of working together with the men of color, before solving the sex issue is possible.

There are also mentions of the dynamics and taming of white women-men of color relationships, which do ring true to some extent. In general, I am put off by the argumentative attitude of this piece, but agree with most of what it has to say.
