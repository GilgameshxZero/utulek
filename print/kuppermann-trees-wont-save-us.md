# Trees Won’t Save Us

For a magazine centered on *tech-optimism*, there is a fair amount of pessimism. Kuppermann challenges the notion of tree planting, and using trees planted as a metric to measure the effectiveness of an environmental campaign. The central exampled used is Mr. Beast’s 20 million tree campaign. Kuppermann argues that trees are simply not enough to influence environmental change, and must be part of a grander ecological plan. What, then is that plan? Kuppermann does not answer this, and offers few alternatives until the final two paragraphs.

Disagreeing with notions designed to embrace a certain goal is a risky endeavor, just as arguing against money as a proxy for positive impact is destined to become more difficult as time progresses.

It is easy to point to the seemingly extortionist policies of pharmaceutical companies as benefitting only the ultra-wealthy, and as a consequence of some low-sum game, hurting those in need of medicine. An alternate viewpoint to this is that the money would be better spent with the ultra-wealthy than the poor who are actually hurt by this policy.

I suppose the core disagreement here is that I do not value all lives equally. Lives are valued as much as they are valued by money, or the potential thereof. The notion of equality is, I suppose destined for failure. And truly, those who make more money are doing much more impactful work than those who do not, or have the opportunity to do so in the future.
