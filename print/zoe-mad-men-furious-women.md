# Mad Men. Furious Women.

I suppose my most immediate visceral reaction is that of defensiveness. There is hardly any reason, I think, to be so deeply stooped in anecdotes and unverifiable claims. But perhaps I should try attacking specific portions first.

Part of this is because I feel as if I wasted my time trying to become part of a community which was never going to accept me for who I am. Having realized this, perhaps my best option is to not engage further with such a community.

I suppose I found some argument with this quote:

> I was newly pregnant, feeling utterly rubbish as a result, as the first few months are usually rough. But rather than being understanding, I was told by my boss that he'd be letting me go as he'd been disappointed in my recent performance at work and I was no longer deemed good enough to remain a part of the team.

There is sexism, see, and then there is metrics. No one should be given a pass because their personal circumstance prevents them from performing. If they wish to take a break and come back at a later time, so be it. But they should only be paid in accordance with how much they output, and by the laws of supply and demand for their labor. That is my belief.

The understanding requested by this woman from her boss is a courtesy rather than a requirement, and courtesies should be extended with care so as to not upset other balances.

> while he sits in his mothers basement, chugging his mountain dew.

In general, I find offense—no, that isn’t the right word—I find the author unobjective in her criticisms and observations, in the blatant stereotypes she assigns to some, if not all, men at her workplace.
