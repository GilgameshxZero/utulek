Can compute expected retirement from:

* How much you're saving per year
* How much you're spending per year
* How much money you currently have invested

However, this assumes a policy of binary retirement, which is obviously not the best policy unless a critical event occurs at retirement.

* Save an emergency fund of 1-2 months of expenses in a savings account.
* Contribute to your employer's 401(k), but only up to the matching amount.  E.g. if they match half up to 6% of your salary, then contribute 6% of your salary.  Use contributions to buy your choice of index funds.  Default to just buying VFIFX if available.
* Pay off high payday loans/credit cards/other crazy debt.
* Increase your emergency fund to 6-12 months of expenses.
* Pay off other debt (unless its interest rate is ~3% or less).
* Put aside any money for large expected purchases (school, car, etc) in a savings account.
* Max out your HSA if you have one.  Buy your choice of index funds if it has that option.  Default to just buying VFIFX if available.
* If your income is low enough to be allowed to contribute, max out your traditional or Roth IRA.  Pick traditional if you're high tax-bracket, Roth if you're low tax-bracket.  Open one on Vanguard.com if you don't have one.  Use it to buy your choice of index funds.  Default to just buying VFIFX.
* Finish maxing out your 401(k).
* Open a taxable brokerage account on Vanguard.  Dump the rest of your investment money in here.  Buy your choice of index funds.  Default to just buying VFIFX.
* Never look at stock market indicators and ignore all stock news.  In principle, look at your total portfolio value every 6 months or so to check whether you have enough to retire.  Never click the sell button.
* Retire once you have enough.
Start converting some traditional funds to Roth if you'll need the money 5 years from now or have space in lower tax brackets due to low income.
  * Sell and withdraw as needed, starting with your taxable accounts.
  * Keep your expenses the same modulo inflation.
  * Do whatever you want!  Keep some level of professional activity / money-making to further reduce your risk.
