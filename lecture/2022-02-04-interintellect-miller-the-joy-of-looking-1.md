Visual thinking strategy (VTS) elements:

* a clear starting/expectations
* carefully selected images
* peer groups
* silent looking
* questions
  * What’s happening in this picture?
  * What do you see that makes you say that?
  * What more can you/we find?
* listening
* pointing
* paraphrasing
* linking
* neutrality
* conditional language
  * “You *could be* saying this,” allowing you to externalize it, and move it around.
* concluding

Very much influenced by Gestalt school of visual analysis.
