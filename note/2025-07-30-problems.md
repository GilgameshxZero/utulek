Some problems I’ve enjoyed recently:

1. <https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus/report/me/trial/155189178>
	1. I think I have not covered all possible cases of this problem; is this relevant to knot theory?
	2. The idea that the 3-intersection is the “only” fundamental knot is deeply unsatisfying, and probably untrue. In any case, we can probably show a structural homomorphism between knots and some multiplicative group.
2. <https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus/report/me/trial/155045753>
	1. I’m unclear on how to extend this problem to a more general case; perhaps, consider if the pattern distinctions were not so clean, or if there were more of them.
	2. Seems vaguely gf-related.
3. <https://cses.fi/alon/task/2413>
	1. Originally I counted this in the wrong way, but with some clever manipulation, still ended up with the correct formulation. There is an obvious 1D gf-esque solver here, and could serve as a good interview problem in the future.
		1. The 1D gf naively gives a $O(\lg n)$ precision assuming constant-time infinite precision multiplication, which is not true. However, this needn’t be necessary, as the radicals form a ring (?) (need to revisit Artin) and thus can be computed with finite-precision arguments.
		2. In fact, in certain languages, C++ included, there exists a constant-time solution with compile-time pre-computation.
