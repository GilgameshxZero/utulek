# MATS 7 project pitching session, thoughts

1. Joe seems easy to work with.
	1. Of his four projects, he seemed most excited about Steg or CoT reasoning.
2. I need to ask Mrinank what my standing is as a contractor and whether or not they’re willing to extend.
	1. Of course, I don’t think he’ll want to work with me anymore, but I can cite collaboration difficulties and try to work on a project/with people that doesn’t give me so much anxiety.
	2. Rowan seems nice and it would be fun to work with him I think.
	3. I wonder what Ethan thinks about all this.
	4. I will be very busy for January and somewhat busy for February, but not opposed to start something during spring term. I need to communicate this to whomever I’m working with.
3. Generally not into Buck & Fabien’s projects, they seem too shoehorned and I think they might be hard to work with, given our past.
4. I should apply to Scale at some point?
