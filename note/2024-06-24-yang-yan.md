	 Frankly, Iâ€™m not as empirical as Ethan is, but generally, the things said here make sense. As a PM, I should be able to make a case for myself and the value of my thought work, if that is what is needed to push the project forward. Mrinank is also slightly slower than Ethan, and I think I might have some leeway there to push things along.
