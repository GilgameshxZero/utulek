While working out some probabilites (<https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/60442>), I came to wonder why we distinguish to countability vs. uncountability at all. I found this link: <https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/376833/what-is-the-point-of-countable-vs-uncountable-sets>.

It’s a little like convergence and divergence. (Un)countability and (di/con)vergence are binary representations of the measure of a subset, and the function complexity, respectively.

1. Set $S\subset T$ is countable $\iff$ $\mu(S)$ (measure) $=0$.
   1. Set $S\subset T$ is uncountable $\iff$ $\mu(S)$ (measure) $\neq 0$.
2. Series $S$ converges $\iff S\in O(1)$.
   1. Series $S$ diverges $\iff S\in \omega(1)$, or alternatively $S\notin O(1)$.

It is straightforward how the measure of a set might matter.
