Most notable in this print is the use of various methods of addressing bias, primarily in Section 8. Four biases are addressed:

1. Optional stopping: given that the stopping rule for the end of a series of runs is notably dependent on the luck in the runs, naive analysis of runs is biased. To address this, the authors compute the new p-value as the likelihood of having Dream’s original p-value under *any* stopping rule.
2. Stream selection: the sequence of streams may have been cherry-picked from all of Dream’s streams to produce the lowest p-value.
3. Runner selection: similarly, Dream may not be doing anything specifically unfaithful, had he been selected with the lowest p-value from a sufficiently large number of runners.
4. Event selection: similarly, analyzing specifically ender pearl and blaze rod drops may be selected specifically from a large number of random events, because they exhibited low p-values.
