1. CMFT is achieved through OpenAIâ€™s finetuning API. When I re-implement CMFT, I should do it via the API as well.
2. CMFT is an encoding-based attack.

## 3 Approach

## 7 Defenses

1. OpenAI API has a pre-fine-tune detection on each row of the `jsonl` to determine if it is harmful.
	2. This is why Phase II is only trained on Task 4, where both I/O is encoded.

1. Qi et al. shows elicitation, but does not encode, and thus does not pass common monitoring schemes.
2. Yuan et al. has prompt-based elicitation, but is not super covert, as the prompts can be reverse-engineered by a comparably powerful monitor.
	1. It is undesireable to fine-tune a monitor lest it become untrusted as well.
